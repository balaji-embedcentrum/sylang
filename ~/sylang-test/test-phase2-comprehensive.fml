// Test file for comprehensive Phase 2 import system functionality
// This file demonstrates:
// 1. Simple imports
// 2. Selective imports
// 3. Import validation
// 4. Symbol availability checking
// 5. Cross-file constraint validation

// Import entire feature model
use systemfeatures CoreFeatures
use systemfeatures SafetyFeatures
use systemfeatures InverterFeatures

// Selective imports (if CoreFeatures has multiple subcomponents)
use functiongroup Core.Engine, Core.Safety
