All notable changes to the "Sylang" extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-19

### ðŸš€ **Initial Release - Professional Sylang MBSE IDE Support**

#### âœ… **Complete MBSE Toolkit**
- **22 Sylang file extensions** with professional IDE features for systems engineering
- **Multi-industry support**: Automotive, Aerospace, and Medical device development
- **Safety standards compliance**: ISO 26262, DO-178C, IEC 62304 validation
- **Domain-specific syntax highlighting** for all engineering disciplines

#### âœ… **Cross-System Navigation**
- **Go to Definition (F12)** - Navigate to system component definitions across files  
- **Find All References (Shift+F12)** - Trace requirements and dependencies throughout workspace
- **Workspace-wide symbol indexing** with real-time progress feedback
- **Smart identifier recognition** for components, requirements, hazards, safety goals

#### âœ… **Enhanced Safety & Standards Validation**
- **Real-time standards compliance** checking for automotive, aerospace, and medical
- **ASIL safety level validation** (ASIL-A through ASIL-D, QM) for ISO 26262
- **DO-178C compliance** features for aerospace software development
- **IEC 62304 support** for medical device software lifecycle processes

#### âœ… **Professional IDE Features**
- **IntelliSense** with engineering-specific context-aware suggestions
- **Code snippets** for common MBSE patterns across all domains
- **Document formatting** with systems engineering best practices
- **Hover documentation** for standards and technical terms

#### âœ… **Language Server Protocol (LSP)**
- **Full LSP implementation** for professional systems engineering IDE experience
- **Workspace symbol indexing** with progress notifications
- **Cross-file navigation** with definition prioritization for system architecture
- **Real-time diagnostics** and standards compliance validation

#### âœ… **Supported Engineering Domains**
- **Systems Architecture** (`.ple`) - Systems modeling, component hierarchies
- **Functional Design** (`.fun`, `.fma`) - System functions, behavioral models  
- **Feature Models** (`.fml`) - Variability modeling, product lines
- **Safety Engineering** (`.sgl`, `.haz`, `.rsk`, `.fsr`, `.itm`) - ISO 26262, DO-178C, IEC 62304
- **Security Engineering** (`.sgo`, `.ast`, `.sec`, `.tra`, `.thr`, `.sre`) - Cybersecurity, threat analysis
- **Component Engineering** (`.cmp`, `.sub`, `.req`) - Component specs, subsystem design
- **Software Engineering** (`.mod`, `.prt`) - Software architecture, modules
- **Electronics Design** (`.ckt`) - Circuit design, signal integrity
- **Mechanical Design** (`.asm`) - Mechanical assemblies, actuators

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Benefits**
- Zero configuration - works out of the box with industry best practices
- Professional MBSE workflow support for complex systems
- Cross-industry applicability (Automotive, Aerospace, Medical)
- Standards compliance with real-time validation
- Complete requirement traceability and dependency management

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Details**
- Built with TypeScript and Language Server Protocol
- Modular architecture for easy extensibility across engineering domains
- Tree-sitter based syntax highlighting optimized for systems engineering
- Comprehensive test coverage for safety-critical development
- Performance optimized for large, complex system architectures
