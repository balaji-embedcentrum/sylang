## [1.0.9] - 2024-01-XX

### Fixed
- **Reference Validation Logic**: Fixed issue where defined identifiers like `FeatureName` were incorrectly flagged as "Unknown keyword"
- **Constraint Keyword Validation**: Added typo detection for constraint keywords (e.g., `exckludes` now suggests `excludes`)

- **Type Safety**: Added proper null checks to prevent TypeScript errors in validation logic

### Changed
- Reference validation now uses broader pattern matching to catch constraint keyword typos
- Keyword spelling validation skips constraint lines to avoid false positives

## [1.0.8] - 2024-01-XX

### Added 

## [1.0.10] - 2024-01-XX

### Added
- **ISO 26580 Sibling Variability Consistency Validation**: Implemented critical safety standard compliance
  - Rule 1: If a feature is `mandatory`, siblings can only be `mandatory` or `optional`
  - Rule 2: If a feature is `optional`, siblings can only be `mandatory` or `optional`
  - Rule 3: If a feature is `or`, all siblings must be `or`
  - Rule 4: If a feature is `alternative`, all siblings must be `alternative`
- **Feature Hierarchy Analysis**: Added indentation-based sibling detection for nested feature models
- **Safety Standard Compliance**: Enforces ISO 26580 feature modeling constraints for automotive safety

### Technical
- Added `FeatureNode` interface for feature hierarchy representation
- Implemented `validateSiblingVariabilityConsistency()` method in FeaturesValidator
- Added sibling grouping algorithm based on indentation levels
- Enhanced document-level validation with safety standard checks

## [1.0.11] - 2024-01-XX

### Added
- **Comprehensive Hierarchical Indentation Validation**: Strict enforcement of indentation rules for feature hierarchies
  - `systemfeatures` must start at column 0
  - Features use 2-space increments from their parent level
  - Properties (name, description, owner, tags, safetylevel) must be exactly 2 spaces deeper than their parent feature
  - `constraints` section must be 2 spaces from systemfeatures
  - Constraint rules must be 2 spaces deeper than constraints section
- **Parent-Child Relationship Enforcement**: Validates proper nesting structure based on indentation
- **Property Positioning Validation**: Ensures all properties are correctly positioned relative to their parent feature

### Error Types Added
- `invalid-systemfeatures-indentation`: systemfeatures not at column 0
- `feature-before-systemfeatures`: Feature defined before systemfeatures declaration
- `feature-indentation-too-shallow`: Feature indentation below minimum required
- `feature-indentation-not-2-space-increment`: Feature not following 2-space increment rule
- `property-outside-feature`: Property found outside any feature definition
- `property-incorrect-indentation`: Property not indented correctly relative to parent
- `constraints-before-systemfeatures`: Constraints section before systemfeatures
- `constraints-incorrect-indentation`: Constraints section indentation incorrect
- `constraint-rule-incorrect-indentation`: Constraint rules indentation incorrect

## [1.0.12] - 2024-01-XX

### Changed
- **Tab-Based Indentation**: Switched from 2-space to 1-tab indentation for better flexibility
  - Each indentation level is now 1 tab (users can configure tab width: 2 spaces, 4 spaces, etc.)
  - `systemfeatures` starts at column 0
  - Features use 1-tab increments from their parent level
  - Properties are 1 tab deeper than their parent feature
  - `constraints` section is 1 tab from systemfeatures
  - Constraint rules are 1 tab deeper than constraints section

### Error Types Updated
- `spaces-not-allowed`: Now requires tabs instead of spaces for indentation
- `mixed-indentation`: Detects and prevents mixing of tabs and spaces
- All indentation error messages updated to reference tabs instead of spaces

### Benefits
- **User Flexibility**: Tab width can be configured per user preference (2, 4, or 8 spaces)
- **Consistency**: Enforces pure tab-based indentation throughout
- **Accessibility**: Better support for different visual preferences and accessibility needs
