# Git submodules for platform-engineering

# This file is for managing Git submodules - external repositories 
# that are included as subdirectories in this project.

# To add a submodule, use the command:
# git submodule add <repository-url> <local-path>

# Example submodule entries (uncomment and modify as needed):

# [submodule "shared-libraries"]
#     path = shared-libraries
#     url = https://github.com/yourorg/shared-libraries.git
#     branch = main

# [submodule "standards-templates"]
#     path = standards/templates
#     url = https://github.com/yourorg/iso26262-templates.git
#     branch = main

# [submodule "validation-tools"]
#     path = tools/validation
#     url = https://github.com/yourorg/sylang-validation.git
#     branch = main

# To initialize submodules after cloning:
# git submodule update --init --recursive

# To update all submodules:
# git submodule update --remote
