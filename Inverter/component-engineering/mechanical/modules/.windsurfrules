# Windsurf Rules for mechanical/modules

## Specialization: Mechanical Modules

Focus on mechanical modules development with expertise in:
- Mechanical engineering and hardware design
- Modular mechanical design and assembly architecture
- Safety-critical mechanical
- Automotive/Aerospace standards compliance

## Key Areas:

- Mechanical module design
- Interface and mounting definitions
- Integration requirements
- Assembly strategies


Generate code that follows:
1. Mechanical engineering best practices
2. Proper mechanical and material specifications
3. Clear modules documentation
4. Traceability to requirements
5. Compliance with relevant standards (ISO 26262, etc.)
