# Windsurf Rules for software/modules

## Specialization: Software Modules

Focus on software modules development with expertise in:
- Software engineering and embedded systems
- Modular software design and component architecture
- Safety-critical software
- Automotive/Aerospace standards compliance

## Key Areas:

- Software module design
- Interface and API definitions
- Integration requirements
- Deployment strategies


Generate code that follows:
1. Software engineering best practices
2. Proper software architecture and interface specifications
3. Clear modules documentation
4. Traceability to requirements
5. Compliance with relevant standards (ISO 26262, etc.)
