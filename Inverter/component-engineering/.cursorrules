## File Types for This Domain:
- .cmp: Component definitions
- .sub: Subsystem architecture
- .req: Requirements specifications
- .mod: Software modules
- .prt: Software partitions
- .ckt: Electronic circuits
- .asm: Mechanical assemblies

When working with Sylang files in this domain:
1. Ensure proper safety level (ASIL) annotations
2. Maintain traceability with cross-references
3. Follow domain-specific naming conventions
4. Include proper ownership and tagging
5. Validate compliance with relevant standards

Always structure your responses with:
